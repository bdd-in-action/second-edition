Business Need: Registering as a new Frequent Flyer

  New Frequent Flyer members need to register to book a flight.

  Rule: Customers must register to be able to use the Frequent Flyer members area
    Example: Tracy registers as a Frequent Flyer member
      Given Tracy does not have a Frequent Flyer account
      When Tracy registers as a Frequent Flyer member
      Then he should be able to log on to the Frequent Flyer application
