## Flying High Acceptance Tests - Page Objects

Sample code for Chapter 11 of BDD in Action.

To run these tests locally, you will need to run the Flying High demo application on your machine. 
You can find this application in the [flying-high-app](https://github.com/bdd-in-action/second-edition/tree/master/flying-high-app) directory. 
Open this directory in a console window and follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/bdd-in-action/second-edition/tree/master/flying-high-app/README.md) file.

To run the tests themselves, run:
```
mvn verify
```
