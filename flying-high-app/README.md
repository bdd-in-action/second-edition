# Demo flight app
This app consists of front-end (Angular) and back-end (Nestjs).<br>
You need to install nodejs and npm to start the app.<br>
Go to the server directory and you'll see a dist folder which contains the built files of the back-end and a web folder which contains the web built files.<br>
In this server directory, install all back-end dependencies by using `npm install` and then simply start the app by using `node dist/main`<br>
If you want to develop the project by yourself, please refer to the README in the server or web folder.
